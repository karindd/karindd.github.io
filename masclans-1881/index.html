                        <p>Masclans 1881 is a family-owned business of six generations in the food industry, based in Barcelona. From their market stand in the historical market Galvany, Masclans 1881 offers takeaway gourmet meals and premium codfish from Iceland. Their products are mainly inspired by the local Catalan cuisine, but they also offer fusion food.</p>

                        <p>Masclans 1881 is a well-established company with loyal customers, but they were lacking a unified brand identity and an online presence. This is why the company needed help to create new brand guidelines and launch a website, as a strategy to give more visibility to the brand as a reference in their niche.</p>

The objective of this dynamic was to kick-start the project by getting familiar with the food market industry and understanding the company's point of view. As Masclans 1881 is a company with six generations of experience in their niche it was very valuable to learn about their experience and insights for the research and design process.

                            <p>The observations and empathy map gave us important information about the customers visiting the market stand. Through these findings, we learned how certain needs, motivations, and frustrations were divided between different types of customers depending on sociodemographic characteristics. For example, we observed how the older generation of customers socialize more in the market and are more concerned with prices and grocery delivery. While the younger generation is more focused on treating themselves and the family with premium foods and saving time in the kitchen.</p>
                           <p>I used the Persona model to explore these two customer profiles further and to get a deeper and more personal understanding of their different points of view.</p>

    <h2>Logo Design</h2>
<p class="margin-bottom--md">To further establish the brand identity I created a concept for a logo that embodies the brand's values and history. As the codfish from Iceland is Masclans 1881's flagship product since six generations back I came up with the idea to create a symbol as a wave that could also stand for the "M" in Masclans. The abstract shape yet simple shape represents the brand's connection to the sea and its creative and traditional personality.</p>

<h2>Information Architecture & Content Strategy</h2>
<p>As solid information architecture is the foundation for a good user experience, I kicked off the design process by putting content first. When defining the information architecture and content strategy for the website, we looked for a way to align the business objectives with the customer's needs, and intent when using the website.</p>
<p>The focus was therefore to welcome customers to the market, showcase the products, and provide information about the delivery service. We also highlighted the quality of the products and Masclans long history and expertise in the sector, as we discovered in the research that this is something that the customers value. This is also aligned with the objective to present Masclans as a brand that is a reference in their niche.</p>

<h2>Wireframing</h2>
<p>After defining the content and the structure of the website, I created wireframes for both mobile and desktop, to plan the layout of the interface, the visual consistency and hierarchy before creating the high-fidelity prototype. </p>

        <h1>Final thoughts</h1>
        <p class="margin-bottom--lg">Following the design thinking process was a valuable experience, as we created a website and a brand identity based on both customer and market research. It was an interesting challenge to help digitalize a traditional company, to keep them connected their customers, inside and outside of the market. I believe we have met the objectives established. When the website is launched I will follow up with more concrete metrics to measure the success.  </p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<div class="margin-left margin-bottom--lg">
    <ul class="project__ul project__ul--masclans">
        <li>I learned the value of understanding and exploring the context of the challenge. This helped me to not only empathize better with the customers, but also to learn what's valuable to, and about, the business in it's environment.</li>
        <li>CX Research can be a great resource to find inspiration for a design concept based on insights.</li>
        <li>A solid information architecture even for a simple website can really help to streamline the design process and set the base for the generation of content.</li>
      </ul>
</div>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<div class="margin-left">
    <ul class="project__ul project__ul--masclans">
        <li>Conduct user tests of this first prototype and apply iterations.</li>
        <li>Deliver and launch the product</li>
        <li>Continue the collaboration with the company once the website is launched to maintain it, analyze the results.</li>
